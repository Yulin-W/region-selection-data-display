# Possible future changes (though unlikely in near term)
- Clean up code and do code partition to separate files for ease of access
- More code commenting
- Make the region label change process react like, i.e. use states to do it not vanilla js event listeners
- Experiment with live reading of data from worldbank database (though so far attempts have been quite slow and not responsive)
- Add more selectable indicators
- Improve python data fetching performance (e.g. consider fetching a single long list of data from the worldbank api instead of doing it by country and by region)
- Allow more choices of basemap tilelayer
- Get rid of the needing to copy and paste nation-data-preparer region data json file to the src folder step; just directly make app read data from the github path of the json file via a url fetch
- Display year of data per cell
- Multiple selections
